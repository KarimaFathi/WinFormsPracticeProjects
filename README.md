# WinFormsPracticeProjects

This repository contains my practice projects in WinForms. The project ideas are inspired by the Telegram channel **GHADER-AHMAD in Programming Advices**.

## Projects

### Project 1 – Random Character Generator  

**Description:**  
- The user is prompted to enter the number of characters for generating a random string.  
- To ensure valid input (no empty fields, non-numeric characters, or negative numbers), the `ErrorProvider` control is used.  
- After validation, the user can choose whether the result should include:  
  - Letters (uppercase or lowercase, selectable via `ContextMenuStrip`)  
  - Numbers  
  - Symbols  
  - A mix of all types  
- The generated result is displayed when the **Generate** button is clicked. The user can also **Reset** the form or **Exit** it.  

**Demo:**

### Project 2 – Random Keys Generator  

**Description:**  
- The user is prompted to enter the number of keys for generating a random number of keys of the form "Key[X] : YYYY-YYYY-YYYY-YYYY".  
- To ensure valid input (no empty fields, non-numeric characters, or negative numbers), the `ErrorProvider` control is used.  
- After validation, the user can choose whether the result should include:  
  - Capital letters
  - Small letters
  - A mix of types

### Project 5 – Text Encryption & Decryption Tool

**Description:**  
This project performs text encryption and decryption based on a user-defined key value. The interface is divided into two panels:

Encryption Panel: Allows the user to enter plain text, select an encryption key, and generate the corresponding encrypted text.

Decryption Panel: Provides the reverse functionality, enabling the user to input encrypted text, select the same key, and retrieve the original plain text.

**Demo:**
