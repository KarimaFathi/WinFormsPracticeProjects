This repository contains my practice projects in WinForms. The project ideas are inspired by the Telegram channel **GHADER-AHMAD in Programming Advices**.

## Projects

### Project 1 â€“ Random Character Generator  

**Description:**  
- The user is prompted to enter the number of characters for generating a random string.  
- To ensure valid input (no empty fields, non-numeric characters, or negative numbers), the `ErrorProvider` control is used.  
- After validation, the user can choose whether the result should include:  
  - Letters (uppercase or lowercase, selectable via `ContextMenuStrip`)  
  - Numbers  
  - Symbols  
  - A mix of all types  
- The generated result is displayed when the **Generate** button is clicked. The user can also **Reset** the form or **Exit** it.
